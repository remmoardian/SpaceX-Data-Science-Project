In this culminating activity, we will determine whether or not the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. On its website, SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars each; other companies charge upwards of 165 million dollars each. A significant portion of the savings is achieved since SpaceX is able to reuse the first stage. Therefore, we will be able to calculate the cost of a launch if we can identify whether or not the first stage will land successfully. If any firm than SpaceX wishes to compete with SpaceX for the launch of a rocket, they can use the information provided here. In this exercise, you will connect to an API to retrieve data and validate that it is stored in the appropriate manner. The description that follows is an illustration of a successful and launch.

#Analysis of Launch Sites and Locations Utilizing Folium

The percentage of successful launches may be affected by a wide variety of parameters, including the cargo tonnage, the kind of orbit, and so on. Additionally, it could be dependent on the location and proximity of the launch site, also known as the starting point of the rocket's trajectory. Analyzing the locations of current launch sites can hopefully help us identify some of the criteria involved in selecting the best place for the construction of a launch site. This will require consideration of a large number of factors.

Objectives The following activities are included in this project:
-TASK 1 --> Put a pin in every launch site on the map.
-TASK 2 --> On the map, indicate which sites had successful and which had unsuccessful launches.
-TASK 3 --> Perform the necessary calculations to determine the distances between a launch site and its immediate surroundings.

#Assignment:
Forecasting Using Machine Learning On its website, Space X promises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars each; other suppliers charge upwards of 165 million dollars each. A significant portion of the savings is achieved since Space X is able to reuse the first stage. Therefore, we will be able to calculate the cost of a launch if we can identify whether or not the first stage will land successfully. If another corporation wishes to compete with Space X for a rocket launch contract, they can utilize this information to their advantage. In this lab, you will develop a machine learning pipeline that uses the data from the previous labs to make a prediction on whether or not the first stage will land.

#Objectives:
- Carry out exploratory analyses of the data, and establish what the Training Labels are.
- Make a column that will be used by the class.
- Standardize the data.
- Split into training data and test data.
- Determine the optimal hyperparameter values for the support vector machine, classification trees, and logistic regression.
- Using the test data, determine which method produces the best results.
